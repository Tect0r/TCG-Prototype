# Implementation plan

The only root work queue. It names the next bounded task, the decisions that may
not be reopened while doing it, and the conditions that stop it — and nothing
else. The record of finished work lives in the documents under
[Where the record lives](#where-the-record-lives). Code and passing tests outrank
anything written here.

Baseline audited: `Tect0r/TCG-Prototype` `d49529b` on 2026-08-11. Everything below
has moved since; compare a status with the current branch before relying on it.

## Execution rule

Work on exactly one tranche named by the user. Read only this file, `CLAUDE.md`,
the active milestone file, and the code and documents that tranche directly
references. After verification, update the status table and the tranche's
checklist in the milestone file, then stop.

**The queue is empty.** Every milestone this plan carries is finished, and no
M08 exists yet. M07.8 was a correction pass over M07's output rather than a new
milestone: three cards whose text and structured targets disagreed about who an
effect reaches, the Reaction rule the engine and the product rules told two ways
(Q47), five Goblin cards printing an arrival they do not implement (Q48), the
remote-play instructions, and the three consistency checks M07.7 named but had not
automated.

The next action is an owner decision, not a tranche: the questions under
[Owner decisions still open](#owner-decisions-still-open) are what the
implementation is now waiting on, and `docs/open-questions.md` holds every other
question the project has recorded. Adding a milestone file under
`docs/milestones/` and a row above is what starts the next one.

The largest piece of work the record now names is **content**: reaching the
50-card target needs 8–9 further colour-legal cards per Commander, which is
authoring and balance work rather than a consistency tranche.

## Where the record lives

No finished work is described twice. Each question below has exactly one document
that answers it.

| Question                                       | Document                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What rule is settled and implemented?          | [`docs/rules/confirmed-rules.md`](docs/rules/confirmed-rules.md)                                        |
| What is implemented but provisional?           | [`docs/rules/open-decisions.md`](docs/rules/open-decisions.md)                                          |
| What has no answer yet?                        | [`docs/open-questions.md`](docs/open-questions.md)                                                      |
| How many cards, which versions, what coverage? | [`docs/status-audit.md`](docs/status-audit.md) — generated, and stale means a failing test              |
| What did each milestone make true?             | [`docs/project-status.md`](docs/project-status.md)                                                      |
| What was a tranche's scope, and its checklist? | [`docs/milestones/`](docs/milestones/)                                                                  |
| Why is the architecture the way it is?         | [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/)                                                              |
| What did a tranche say when it landed?         | [`docs/history/milestone-log.md`](docs/history/milestone-log.md) — frozen, superseded by the rows above |

## Locked decisions

Do not reopen these while implementing:

- 40-card singleton Wave 1 decks; Commander outside the deck. Confirmed by the
  owner on 2026-08-14 as the **first-playtest scope**, with a 50-card target kept
  for later and blocked on content — each Commander's colour-legal pool is 41–42
  cards, so 50 needs 8–9 more per Commander. Do not move the format's `deck.size`
  without that content.
- Unlimited Units; one active Relic.
- Commander defeat returns it immediately to the Command Zone and raises its
  total deployment cost by 1, capped at 10.
- Newly Deployed duration/blocking/Rush behavior in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Player versus deployed-Commander targeting distinction.
- Current-Health Overwhelm split before Barrier prevention.
- Bounded Reaction windows with one Reaction per eligible player.
- `deployed` and `entersBattlefield` remain separate and are reviewed per card.

## Owner decisions still open

Only stop on these when the active tranche genuinely needs the answer.
`docs/open-questions.md` holds the full write-up of each, and every other open
question the project has recorded.

- Q4: implement or remove `resilient`. M05.1 answered the content half — it is
  now a build error in a `playtest`/`active` set, derived from the mechanic
  support registry — and M05.2 answered the bot half: no pilot pays anything for
  it anywhere. Deleting it from `KEYWORD_IDS` or implementing one of the two
  readings is still yours, and is now the only part left.
- Q44: multiple blockers per attacker.
- Q45: Barrier ordering against future prevention/reduction effects.
- Q46: whether Reactions may carry interactive additional costs.

## Completion evidence for every tranche

- Exact behavior and data/schema changes.
- Focused regression tests.
- Help, pilot, telemetry, replay/hash, protocol, and authoring coverage when the
  mechanic touches them.
- `npm run verify` passing. It covers the root `tsconfig.json` since M01.5;
  nothing needs to be run separately.
- No newly stale player-facing text. Since M07.7 this is checked rather than
  remembered: `npm run check:consistency` reports retired rule vocabulary,
  broken links and anchors, path references to files that do not exist, and any
  documented value that no longer matches the constant or registry it copies.
  M07.8 added three more — an inert mechanic in a playable set, card prose that
  disagrees with its structured targets about who an effect reaches, and a
  question this plan calls open that `docs/open-questions.md` has answered or has
  no record of. It runs inside the suite, so `npm run verify` already covers it.
- `docs/status-audit.md` regenerated with `npm run audit:status` when the tranche
  changed anything it counts. Since M07.1 the suite fails until it is, so this is
  a reminder of the command rather than a duty to remember the numbers.
- Status table and milestone checklist updated in the same change.

## Global stop conditions

Stop rather than widen scope when:

- a rule choice changes gameplay rather than implementation detail;
- current code contradicts the milestone baseline;
- a schema migration could invalidate saved/replay data without a defined policy;
- hidden information would cross an existing observation/view boundary;
- unrelated local changes overlap the required files.
